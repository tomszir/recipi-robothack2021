# ReciPi

Home cooking is a fun and often necessary activity, but what is not fun is having to plan meals in advance. From searching for deals in stores to recipe hunting on clunky websites, which more often than list ingredients in odd measurement systems - the whole process is a hassle. And it's only made worse by the fact that Latvian stores often don't have exactly what the recipe might call for.

We plan to create an intuitive and fast virtual assistant to aid in the shopping and home cooking process, which integrates with the user's local shops and locates the best deals on user-specified items. In addition, our assistant could quickly convert a whole recipe into the metric system as well as suggest potential substitutes for certain ingredients the user might not want to use.

## Running

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
