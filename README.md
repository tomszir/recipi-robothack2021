# ReciPi

A home cooking assistant made in 48h during the [RobotHack2021 Hackathon](https://robothack.co/)!

## Descriptiion

Home cooking is a fun and often necessary activity, but what is not fun is having to plan meals in advance. From searching for deals in stores to recipe hunting on clunky websites, which more often than list ingredients in odd measurement systems - the whole process is a hassle. And it's only made worse by the fact that Latvian stores often don't have exactly what the recipe might call for.

We plan to create an intuitive and fast virtual assistant to aid in the shopping and home cooking process, which integrates with the user's local shops and locates the best deals on user-specified items. In addition, our assistant could quickly convert a whole recipe into the metric system as well as suggest potential substitutes for certain ingredients the user might not want to use.
